            <h1>What is UniLottery?</h1>
            <p>
                UniLottery is a fully decentralized, trustless, and 
                automated Uniswap-based lottery protocol, which combines
                the safe gains of early-trading Locked Liquidity tokens 
                for at least several hours until specific conditions apply,
                and the huge profits the scammers get from rug-pulls - 
                but in case of UniLottery - the profits are used as lottery
                winner funds!
            </p>
            <h2>Want to play? Here's how!</h2>

            <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="roundbord">
                    <h3>Trade!</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        Trade ULT tokens on Uniswap, and make juicy gainz!
                        The more tokens you buy, the more ETH you contribute
                        to Uniswap LP, and the LATER you buy in (!), the
                        more chances of becoming a Lottery Winner you get!
                        <br>
                        However, for selling, everything is reversed!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="roundbord">
                    <h3>Refer other players!</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        Want to increase your Player Score up to 
                        <b>100 points</b> ?!
                        <br>
                        You can become a referrer by generating your 
                        Referral ID, and then give that ID to other players,
                        who, after buying some tokens, can register that ID.
                        <br>
                        When they register, they get 
                        <b>Referree Bonus: 5 points!</b>
                        <br>
                        And the Referrer, whose ID was registered, will get
                        <b>bonus points derived from every referree's player
                        score!</b>
                        <br>
                        So, if you refer several players who get large 
                        scores, their scores propagate back to your 
                        score too!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="roundbord">
                    <h3>Mine!</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        UniLottery utilizes "Mining" approach to execute the
                        lottery ending procedures (moving liquidity and 
                        executing part of winner selection algorithm),
                        to increace decentralization.
                        <br>
                        Everyone can become a Miner, by executing the Mine
                        function on the lottery which just finished!
                        <br>
                        Miners get 1% of lottery surplus ETH from Uniswap LP,
                        so, for example, if lottery's surplus on finish is
                        50 ETH, Miner gets 0.5 ETH, and gas fees are much
                        smaller than that, so - profit!
                        <br>
                        However, you have to be fast - there's only 1-2
                        mining operations per lottery!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="roundbord">
                    <h3>Claim Prizes!</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        After Mining is complete, Lottery Winners can
                        finally claim their prizes!
                        <br>
                        Number of winners is random, and can even be
                        higher than the number of lottery token holders!
                        <br>
                        The #1 winner can get up to 100% of winner funds,
                        but in practice, most winners will get from 1% to 
                        25% of total winner funds.
                        <br><br>
                        Randomness factor is added to player score, to
                        form the Final Score, to determine winners.
                        Default RandRatio is 1:4, so, player score's
                        weight is 20%, and random score's weight is 80%.
                        <br>
                        We can see that the highest-scoring players
                        basically guarantee themselves a solid prize,
                        which in most cases will be much higher than what
                        they contributed during the trading stage!

        <h2>Conditions for liquidity unlock & lottery finish</h2>
        <p>
            Lottery will enter FINISHING stage (when liquidity can be
            unlocked on randomly selected transaction), when ALL of these
            conditions will be reached:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Uptime (Time since start)</td>
                <td class="li_finCond_timeSinceStart"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Winner Funds (<span \
                    class="li_winFundPercentage"></span> of net profits)</td>
                <td class="li_finCond_surplusEth"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Number of Token Holders</td>
                <td class="li_finCond_numberOfHolders"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            If these conditions are not satisfied, Uniswap liquidity is
            FULLY LOCKED, so you can safely trade tokens without fearing of
            liquidity getting removed.
            <br>
            However, the token sells which could drop the current winner funds
            below <span class="li_winFundsDenySells" \
                        style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%"></span>
            will be rejected (transaction will revert) !
            <br>
            This would of course apply only after that amount is reached.
        </p>

        <br>
        <hr>

        <h2>Deflationary properties</h2>
        <p>
            Token is deflationary - for every transaction, a percentage of
            amount transacted is burned, to increase scarcity and discourage
            selling.
            Token utilizes "smart burning" - uses different burn rates for
            buyers, and different for other token transfers, including sells.
            <br>
            The burn rates:
            <br>
            <ul style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%">
                <li>Buyer Rate: <span class="li_burn_buy"></span></li><br>
                <li>Default (Seller) Rate: <span class="li_burn_sell"></span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <br>
        <hr>

        <h2>Current Lottery State</h2>

        <h1>UniLottery - Liquidity Pools turned to Trustless Lottery</h1>
        <p class="roundbord">
            UniLottery is a fully decentralized, trustless, and automated 
            Ethereum lottery ecosystem, utilizing tradeable ERC-20 tokens 
            as "smart lottery tickets", and operating on decentralized 
            liquidity pool-based exchange Uniswap.
            <br>
            Uniswap is used to distribute and track UniLottery (ULT) tokens.
            Every lottery spawned by UniLottery Main Pool is a separate 
            token. 
            <br>
            Lottery Token Contracts check the state of lottery ecosystem
            on every token transfer, and when specific conditions are met
            (time active, number of holders, ETH amount in Uniswap LP), 
            lottery finishes.
            <br>
            After finish, on ENDING stage, during the Mining operation,
            all liquidity from Uniswap's LP is removed, and nearly all of
            surplus ETH obtained is put to the Winner Prize Fund, from
            which the lottery winners are then be able to claim their 
            prizes.
            <br>
            All of the lottery tokens are deployed and liquidity is
            provided automatically and trustlessly, and winner selection
            is done using true random seed obtained from Provable oracle
            service.
            Ending operations also utilize "Lottery Miners", who can earn
            part of lottery profits when executing mining operations.
            <br>
            All ULT token liquidity is FULLY LOCKED for whole lottery
            active lifetime stage, during which token trading is safe,
            as you can't get rug-pulled.
            <br>
            Anyone can track lottery stage, ending conditions, and
            finish probability on our website.
        </p>

        <div class="roundbord">
        <h2>How to profit from UniLottery?</h2>
        <p>
            One can profit by participating in UniLottery in these ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Significant gains from trading UniLottery Tokens: as 
                initial ULT token liquidity is all in Uniswap, and market 
                cap is very low, by getting on early one can make 
                significant gains. Also, on ACTIVE stage there's no risk of
                rug-pulling, because token liquidity is locked in ULT 
                smart contract itself for whole ACTIVE stage.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                Win lottery prizes: After lottery ends, 80% of profits
                from liquidity removal are dedicated to Lottery Winners,
                who are determined using a complex but fair
                Winner-Selection-Algorithm. Algorithm is based on 
                player score, which is comprized of the following parts,
                and can range from <b>1 to 200 points</b>.
                <br> <br>
                Randomness factor is added to this player score on 
                lottery's end, when running winner selection algorithm, to
                form the Final Score, to determine final winners.
                <br>
                RandRatio defines how much weight randomness has in
                the final score.
                <br>
                Default RandRatio is 1:4, so, player score's
                weight is 20%, and random score's weight is 80%.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Player Score's components:</b>

                        the more chances of winning you get! By selling 
                        tokens, you lose points, and by buying, you get 
                        points.

                        to win you get! This is implemented to compensate
                        for price differences when getting in early and
                        later, and to encourage later buyers.

                        other holders who can register their Referral ID.
                        Referrers get additional points for each referree!

            <li>
                Lottery Mining: By executing "mining" operations on 
                finishing lotteries, you earn a part of profits dedicated 
                to miners - "Mining Rewards". 
                These can go as far as 1-2% of total profits. 
                Usually it's only a single mine operation per lottery, so 
                if lottery earns 100 ETH of profits, and mining reward is 
                1%, miner gets 1 ETH for an operation! 
                Gas cost is ~600,000 gas, so it's a profit!

        <h2>UniLottery Ecosystem Contracts Overview</h2>
        <p>
            UniLottery Ecosystem is comprised of 6 core contracts, which
            have been deployed only once, and an unlimited number of 
            individual LotteryStub and LotteryStorageStub contracts, which 
            are deployed automatically by Factories, when new lottery
            starts.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Contracts:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>UniLotteryPool</b> - the main controller contract, which
                governs the top-level state of the ecosystem.
                UniLottery Owner (OWNER_ADDRESS) can provide and withdraw
                liquidity from this pool, which is used as initial
                liquidity for future lotteries.
                <br>
                Finished lotteries transfer part of their surplus ETH
                as profits back to pool, while the rest of surplus ETH
                stay in lottery contracts and are used as winner prizes.
                <br>
                The Pool initiates all new lottery creations, manually,
                or automatically, using Scheduled Callbacks.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <b>RandomnessProvider</b> - an abstraction and encapsulation
                contract acting as an interface to Provable oracle
                services, which are used to obtain random seeds for
                Lottery winner selection algorithm, when lotteries end.
                <br>
                Also, utilizing Provable Scheduled Callback functionality,
                RandomnessProvider can be used to schedule Auto-Lotteries
                to be run automatically - when one lottery ends, another
                begins.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <b>LotteryFactory</b> - a Factory contract which creates
                new lotteries (which are composed of a LotteryStub
                contract, and LotteryStorageStub contract).
                <br>
                On initial deployment, this factory also deployed the
                "Lottery" contract, which contains code for all 
                individual lottery token contracts (LotteryStubs).
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <b>StorageFactory</b> - a Factory contract which creates
                new LotteryStorageStub contracts, which are then passed
                to LotteryFactory to integrate into the Lottery Token
                (comprised of LotteryStub and LotteryStorageStub).
                <br>
                On initial deployment, this factory also deployed the
                "LotteryStorage" contract, which contains code for all 
                individual lottery storage contracts (LotteryStorageStubs).
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <b>Lottery</b> - the Logic contract, which contains all
                code for Lottery Token implementation.
                <br>
                Individual Lottery Tokens (LotteryStub contracts) use
                "DelegateCall" EVM technique to execute this code on
                their contract behalf (using LotteryStub's state and
                address as "this", but executing Lottery's code).
                <br>
                This pattern is used to greatly reduce deployment costs,
                as individual lottery (LotteryStub) contracts don't have
                to contain all the code, which would otherwise be
                duplicated.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <b>LotteryStorage</b> - the Logic contract, which contains
                all code for LotteryStorageStub's implementation.
                <br>
                The same pattern is used as for Lottery and LotteryStub,
                but this time, it's for LotteryStorageStub.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <b>LotteryStub</b> - the Proxy Stub contract used as
                Lottery Token Contract for every lottery to be deployed.
                <br>
                This contract DelegateCalls the Lottery contract to
                execute actual code on it's behalf.
                <br>
                This is the actual ERC20 token contract that traders use
                to trade on Uniswap, and also to perform all other lottery
                tasks, such as referral management, mining, and prize
                claiming.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <b>LotteryStorageStub</b> - the Proxy Stub contract used
                as LotteryStorage contract by every lottery deployed.
                <br>
                This contract's use is purely internal - it's used by
                the Lottery Token to store all Holder Data (player score
                parameters, etc.), and also, this contract executes
                all the Winner Selection Algorithms, because they
                require fast access to holder data, which is stored
                in this contract's state.
